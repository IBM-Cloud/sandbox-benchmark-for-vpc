### Purpose of the IBM Cloud Virtual Servers for VPC sandbox

The IBM Cloud VPC sandbox is a customer managed, automated deployment/configuration, that is
deployed into your IBM account using the virtual server instances (VSIs). Resources that are
created by the automated deployment are owned by you. Management of those resources is your
responsibility. IBM creates and configures the sandbox installation and infrastructure required by
using best practices.

The goal of the sandbox is to provide a non-production playground environment, enabling you to
quickly benchmark various workloads for their performance on the latest IBM Cloud VSIs. You can
run pre-selected workload benchmarks or deploy your own application workloads for performance
evaluation.

### User Journey

This section outlines a top-level overview, showcasing the entire journey for the user to deploy
the IBM Cloud VPC sandbox.

#### Step 1: Deploy IBM Cloud VPC sandbox deployment using IBM Cloud Schematics

- Log in to the IBM Cloud account and select the IBM Cloud Schematics service.
- Create an IBM Cloud Schematics workspace with the sandbox GitHub repository and deploy the IBM
  Cloud VPC sandbox.Please refer [VPC sandbox deployment step 3 ](#ibm-cloud-virtual-servers-for-vpc-sandbox-deployment) for more details on the required input variables. This process takes approximately 20 minutes.

#### Step 2: Setup application VSIs from sandbox dashboard portal

- Access the sandbox dashboard from a local browser using '<http://localhost:38080>' and log in
  with 'admin' credentials.
- Deploy the application VSIs by clicking on the Setup button.

#### Step 3: Run preselected benchmark application or user application

- After setup completion, run the benchmark applications.

#### Step 4: Evaluate performance data

- Navigate to the performance dashboard page and evaluate performance data for preselected
  benchmark applications or user application.

#### Step 5: Delete Application VSIs

- After evaluating performance data, delete the application VSIs.

Important Note: Please note that when you run the IBM Cloud Virtual Servers for VPC sandbox, you
will incur the respective costs for the IBM Cloud resources used.  To minimize the costs of
running the sandbox, please use the "Delete process‚Äù after every application that you setup and
run in the sandbox dashboard to evaluate performance. After deleting the individual sandbox
applications VSIs resources, you must also delete the corresponding workspace environment
separately using IBM Cloud Schematics capability to eliminate incurring any costs for the sandbox.
IBM Schematics will not delete application VSIs created from the sandbox dashboard. Users must
delete them from the sandbox dashboard only.

#### Step 6: Destroy IBM Cloud VPC sandbox resources via IBM Schematics and delete the workspace

- Once the application VSIs are deleted, destroy the IBM Cloud VPC sandbox resources and delete
  the IBM Schematics workspace.

### IBM Cloud Virtual Servers for VPC sandbox deployment

2. Create a Schematics workspace and deploy the IBM Cloud sandbox environment with the
   IBM-provided GitHub URL where the Terraform module exists. The repository located at
   <https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sandbox-benchmark-for-vpc.git> will be used in Schematics Workspace.

![](./images/image2.png)

3. After you create the sandbox workspace, provide the required inputs in the IBM Schematics for
   Terraform module and click "Apply plan" to deploy the sandbox environment. Here are the
   necessary input variables:
   - **ibmcloud_api_key**: Obtain this value by completing the prerequisites.
   - **ibmcloud_ssh_key_name**: Obtain this value by completing the prerequisites. Additionally,
     download the SSH private key, which will be used to log in to the Bastion host.
   - **resource_group**: Obtain this value by completing the prerequisites.
   - **personal_access_token**: Obtain this value by completing the prerequisites, Internal IBM use only.
   - **zones**: `["us-south-1"]`
     Optionally, you can choose `us-south-2` or `us-south-3`.
   - **remote_allowed_ips**: Your Public IP address, from which you intend to access the sandbox
     dashboard, should be provided in this format: `["PublicIP"]`.
   - **logdna_integration**: Set to `true`.
     You can choose false if you don't want LogDNA integration.
   - **logdna_plan**: Set to `lite`
     Valid options are `lite`, `7-day`, `14-day`, `30-day`, `hipaa`.
   - **sandbox_ui_repo_url**: Set to `https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sandbox-benchmark-dashboard-for-vpc/archive/main.zip`
   - **sandbox_uipassword**: Provide the sandbox dashboard password

   The repository located at <https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sandbox-benchmark-dashboard-for-vpc.git> will be
   used for setting up the sandbox dashboard application.

4. After a successful "Apply plan", you get the sandbox **access_info** command in the Terraform
   output. You can use the **access_info** command in your local terminal and access the sandbox
   environment from your browser. See the following sample access_info command output:

   `ssh -i [SSHKeyPath] -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -L
   38080:[DashboardIP]:80 root@[BastionHostIP]`

   SSHKeyPath would be ssh-key private key path which you have passed in Terraform module to
   access the Bastion host. If you don't have any ssh-key created/downloaded before, you can
   create one ssh-key first and use the same key for sandbox environment.

    > NOTE: Don't attach Public IP (FIP) to the dashboard VSI to access the sandbox without
    > Bastion host. **The setup of the sandbox application will take approximately 15 minutes
    > after the apply plan shows successful.** You can view the logs in LogDNA instance also. See
    > [View LogDNA Logs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-launch)

    After the command runs successfully, the tunnel is set up between the local machine and the
    bastion host. The sandbox dashboard can be accessed from the local browser by running the
    following command:

    `http://localhost:38080`

    If the apply plan fails, please check the errors in the Terraform outputs.

**Apply plan shows successful:**

You can get the access_info command details from the Terraform outputs as shown in below
screenshot.

**PreSelected Performance Applications or Workloads**

The sandbox targets two application workloads and one customer-owned application.

1. **Monte Carlo Simulation:** It is a Financial Workload sample app based on mathematical
    technique with some default load values that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain
    numerical results. This will provide the Operations per Second as a performance metric and API
    will capture Memory Utilization, CPU Utilization as well for each benchmark run.

    In Monte Carlo workload, 8 or 16 vCPUs VSIs profiles of SPR (Bx3d-8x40 or Bx3d-16x80) and CLX
    (Bx2d-8x32 or Bx2d-16x64) will be deployed and used. It will create two VSIs - CLX-based VSIs
    and SPR-based VSIs.

    Reference: [Monte Carlo Simulation](https://github.com/intel/Financial-Services-Workload-Samples/tree/main/MonteCarloEuropeanOptions)

2. **HuggingFace Inference Application:** The HuggingFace inference-based benchmark runs several
    NLP models on a text classification task: Bert-base-uncased and Roberta-base. Working with
    popular HuggingFace transformers implemented with PyTorch and the latest version of
    HuggingFace Optimum Intel, an open-source library dedicated to hardware acceleration for Intel
    platforms.

    For HuggingFace workload, the 16 vCPUs VSIs profiles of SPR (Bx3d-16x80) and CLX (Bx2d-16x64)
    will be deployed and used. It will create two VSIs - CLX-based VSI and SPR-based VSI.

    Reference: [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/blog/intel-sapphire-rapids-inference)

3. **Bring Your Own (BYO) Application:** Users can deploy their own applications to experience the
    performance of the latest generation SPR VSIs and compare it to the previous generation CLX
    VSIs. Users can enter/upload their installer and runner file from the dashboard UI to
    install/run their application. Only supported format is shell scripts.

    For BYO Application workload, the user is provided with 8 or 16 vCPUs VSIs profiles of SPR-based
    (Bx3d-8x40 or Bx3d-16x80) and CLX-based (Bx2d-8x32 or Bx2d-16x64). It will create two VSIs, one
    CLX-based VSI and SPR-based VSI.

**NOTE:** The IBM Cloud sandbox uses **Ubuntu 22.04** image for executing all
the performance benchmarks. Please make sure your BYO application and related runner scripts run
successfully in the Ubuntu 22.04 operating system.

### Deploying applications or workloads

1. **Setting up the application VSIs:** You can deploy the VSIs for the selected application or
   workload from the dashboard portal. You can select the VSI profiles and initiate setup of the
   preselected applications or workloads VSIs. It takes around 7-8 minutes to create the VSIs and
   then deploy the preselected application or workloads. You can view the status of the VSIs by
   navigating to the Configurations Details page.

**Installing and setting up the BYO application:**

When you initiates a setup for the BYO application, it allows you an option to pass a
user-data script to install and set up their workload application. The only supported format is
shell scripts. This user-data will be executed by cloud-init in the VSI and copied to
the¬†/var/lib/cloud/instance/¬†directory. You can find the execution logs of the user-data script
in the¬†/var/log/cloud-init-output.log¬†file in the BYO application VSIs. Optionally, you can setup the IBM
Cloud LogDNA service with BYO application VSIs to see the application installation logs.

Below is the sample installation script for BYO application. The sample script also shows how to
setup up LogDNA Service if needed. You need to get the **LOGDNA_INGESTION_KEY** from LogDNA service
and then replace it in the below script to enable the LogDNA for the BYO Application VSIs.

**Sample script to install the user's workload:** Please note that the script below is a sample
only, your script for your application may vary.

```
